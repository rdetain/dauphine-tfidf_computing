Considering the problem of calculating the TF-IDF score for each (word, document) couple in a set of documents, I performed an experimental analysis in order to compare performances of 3 different implementations :

- tf-idf calculation using scikitlearn library,
- tf-idf calculation using MapReduce Hadoop Streaming
- tf-idf calculation using Spark
